# Task

For you, two interfaces have been created: `Human` and `Animal`, as well as one class â€“ `Werewolf`.
Your task is to inherit both interfaces in the `Werewolf` class and then **implement their methods**. In the `Werewolf` class, the **comments above** indicate how you should **override** these methods. A werewolf is **both a human and an animal**, so it has a method called ``transform()``. You should also use the boolean value `isHumanForm` in the methods as instructed.
If the task seems difficult, feel free to use the **Hint** and **Solution** buttons to analyze the solution!
